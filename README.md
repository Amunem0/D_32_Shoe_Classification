# Shoe Classification using Deep Learning

This repository contains the code and resources for a deep learning project aimed at classifying shoes from three popular brands: Nike, Adidas, and Converse. The project utilizes convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with various architectures, including VGG16, EfficientNet, and ResNet50, to achieve accurate classification.

## Dataset
The dataset consists of images of shoes from three classes: Nike, Adidas, and Converse. Unfortunately, the dataset used for training and testing the models is not provided in this repository due to its large size and copyright restrictions. However, you can substitute it with any suitable dataset containing images of shoes from these brands.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook (optional, for running the notebooks)

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/Amunem0/D_32_Shoe_Classification.git
```

2. Install the required dependencies:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


3. Train the models using the provided notebooks or scripts for VGG16, EfficientNet, and ResNet50.

4. Test the trained models using test data or your own images.

## Model Architectures
The repository contains implementations of CNN architectures including VGG16, EfficientNet, and ResNet50. Each architecture has been adapted and trained for classifying shoes from the Nike, Adidas, and Converse brands. Detailed descriptions of the architectures are provided within the source code.

## Results
The performance of each model may vary based on factors such as the quality and size of the dataset, model architecture, and hyperparameters. Evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score for each model are reported within the source code.

## Contributing
Contributions to improve the performance, efficiency, or usability of the code are welcome. Please fork the repository, make your changes, and submit a pull request outlining the proposed changes.
